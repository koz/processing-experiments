# Random Walker
## Color Circle
A random circle walker with self avoiding path that changes colors on each draw.

### v1.0
Initial approach, with very random movement only restricting the movement to bounds of the canvas.

### v1.1
Added some continuity to the movement, the circle always move into a new location that's adjacent to current one. That's really limitate the graphic output, but adds a very more natural movement to the object.
